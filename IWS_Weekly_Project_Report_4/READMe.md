# All-in-One Outdoor Activity Website

## Project Concept
Our vision is to craft a streamlined and user-friendly website catering to enthusiasts of the great outdoors. This hub will be the go-to source for comprehensive details on the best beaches, hiking trails, and scenic overlooks.

## Week 4 Progress Report
In the fourth week of our project, we have made significant strides by integrating a Zipcode Search feature, facilitating the easy discovery of sightseeing locations. Users, upon selecting a place, are presented with a pop-up displaying the address and reviews, providing comprehensive details and navigation assistance. This enhancement enriches the user experience for those interested in outdoor and cultural activities, making both trip planning and exploration more intuitive and enjoyable. Alongside these developments, we are advancing our backend efforts to establish robust database interactions, essential for effective user data management across the Client and login pages. These functionalities can be explored interactively by running the `adventure.html` file.
